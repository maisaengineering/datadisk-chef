datadisk Cookbook
=================

This cookbook formats and mounts a second disk (datadisk) on the specified mountpoint. If you like living dangerously, you can try this with an existing dir by using ::existing_datadir, but that code is less polished (this is done in single user mode using rsync, which is somewhat finicky).

Requirements
------------
- a second disk following the format of /dev/[sx]v?d[a-z], e.g. /dev/sdb or /dev/xvde, containing a partition without filesystem

for the ::existing_datadir recipe:
- an OS using upstart
- recent, working (believe is what you do in church!) backups (though tested and with several failsafes in place, this cookbook still does pretty scary stuff.)

    <td>Only for ::existing_datadir: whether to reboot immediately after the chef run</td>

  </tr>
</table>

Usage
-----
#### datadisk::default

Just include `datadisk` in your node's `run_list`:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[datadisk]"
  ]
}
```

#### datadisk::existing_datadir

Just include `datadisk::existing_datadir` in your node's `run_list`:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[datadisk::existing_datadir]"
  ]
}
```
After the chef run, schedule a reboot on your desired point in time. Since the entire contents of 'datapart' needs to be rsync'd, downtime can be considerable.
